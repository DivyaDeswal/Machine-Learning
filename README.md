# 🤖 Machine Learning Algorithms
Welcome to my Machine Learning Algorithms repository! 🚀 This repo contains Jupyter notebooks implementing Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning algorithms with explanations and code examples.

## 📂 Algorithms Included
### 1️⃣ Linear Regression
📌 Type: Supervised Learning (Regression)

📌 Use Case: Predicting continuous values (e.g., house prices, sales forecasting).

🔧 Libraries Used: sklearn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib.

### 2️⃣ Logistic Regression
📌 Type: Supervised Learning (Classification)

📌 Use Case: Binary classification problems (e.g., spam detection, disease prediction).

🔧 Libraries Used: sklearn, numpy, matplotlib.

### 3️⃣ Decision Tree Algorithm
📌 Type: Supervised Learning (Classification & Regression)

📌 Use Case: Customer segmentation, credit risk assessment.

📌 How it Works:

The model splits data into branches based on feature conditions.
Uses Gini Index or Entropy to determine splits.

Forms a tree structure where leaves represent outcomes.

🔧 Libraries Used: sklearn.tree, pandas, matplotlib.

### 4️⃣ Random Forest Algorithm (Iris Dataset)
📌 Type: Supervised Learning (Classification)

📌 Use Case: Complex classification problems (e.g., medical diagnosis, image recognition).

📌 How it Works:

An ensemble method combining multiple decision trees.
Each tree votes, and the most common prediction is selected (majority voting).
Reduces overfitting compared to a single decision tree.

🔧 Libraries Used: sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier, pandas, matplotlib.

### 5️⃣ K-Means & Hierarchical Clustering
📌 Type: Unsupervised Learning (Clustering)

📌 Use Case: Customer segmentation, anomaly detection.

📌 How it Works:

K-Means Clustering
Defines K clusters (centroids).
Assigns each data point to the nearest cluster center.
Updates centroids until convergence.

#### Hierarchical Clustering
Creates a hierarchy of clusters using Agglomerative (bottom-up) or Divisive (top-down) methods.
Uses Dendrograms to visualize cluster merging.

🔧 Libraries Used: sklearn.cluster, scipy.cluster.hierarchy, matplotlib, seaborn.

#### 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
